# regex match and replace tool

## What is it?
Started as a way to perform simple text functions – make all letters uppercase, make all letters lowercase, and search and replace. I then realized that I could also let users use #regex in the search and replace.

## Features 
This version can do the following:
– find matches (words/phrases), highlight the matches, and indicate total matches
– find matches (regex), highlight matches, count them
– can replace / substitute using regex
– accepts not only a regular expression but also flags
